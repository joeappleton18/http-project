	<h1>HTTP Methods</h1>
	<p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) defines several methods, or verbs, that indicate the desired action to be
		performed on a resource. Each HTTP request typically uses one of these methods:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>GET:</strong> Retrieve data from the server. It should have no other effect on the data.
		</li>
		<li><strong>POST:</strong> Submit data to be processed to a specified resource. It is often used when
			uploading a file or submitting a form.</li>
		<li><strong>PUT:</strong> Update a resource on the server. It replaces the existing resource or creates
			a new one if it doesn't exist.</li>
		<li><strong>DELETE:</strong> Request that a resource be removed. It should be used cautiously because it
			deletes the specified resource.</li>
		<li><strong>PATCH:</strong> Apply partial modifications to a resource. It is used to update a resource
			with new data.</li>
		<li><strong>HEAD:</strong> Similar to GET, but it requests only the headers of the resource without the
			actual data. It is often used to check for the existence of a resource.</li>
		<li><strong>OPTIONS:</strong> Used to describe the communication options for the target resource. It
			allows the client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource.</li>
		<li><strong>TRACE:</strong> Echoes the received request so that a client can see what changes or
			additions have been made by intermediate servers.</li>
		<li><strong>CONNECT:</strong> Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel, usually to
			facilitate SSL-encrypted communication (HTTPS) through an unencrypted HTTP proxy.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>GET</h2>
	<p>GET requests are used to retrieve data from the server. They should have no other effect on the data.</p>
	<form action="/differentRequests" method="GET">
		<label for="name">Name:</label>
		<input type="text" name="name" id="name">
		<button type="submit">Send GET Request</button>
	</form>

	<h2>POST</h2>
	<p>POST requests are used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. They are often used when
		uploading a file or submitting a form.</p>
	<form action="/differentRequests" method="POST">
		<label for="name">Name:</label>
		<input type="text" name="name" id="name">
		<button type="submit">Send POST Request</button>
	</form>

	<h1>HTTP Responses</h1>
	<p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) responses provide information about the status of a request made to a
		server. The
		response is conveyed through a three-digit status code and an optional message. Here are some common
		HTTP
		responses:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>1xx (Informational):</strong> The request was received, continuing process.</li>
		<li><strong>2xx (Success):</strong> The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
		</li>
		<li><strong>3xx (Redirection):</strong> Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the
			request.</li>
		<li><strong>4xx (Client Error):</strong> The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled by the
			server.
		</li>
		<li><strong>5xx (Server Error):</strong> The server failed to fulfill a valid request.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Common Status Codes:</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt><strong>200 OK:</strong></dt>
		<dd>The request was successful, and the server has returned the requested data.</dd>

		<dt><strong>201 Created:</strong></dt>
		<dd>The request was successful, and a new resource was created as a result.</dd>

		<dt><strong>204 No Content:</strong></dt>
		<dd>The server successfully processed the request but there is no content to send back.</dd>
		<dt><strong>300 Moved:</strong></dt>
		<dd>The requested resource has been moved to another location temporarily.</dd>
		
		<dt><strong>301 Permanently Moved:</strong></dt>
		<dd>The requested resource has been permanently moved to another location.</dd>


		<dt><strong>400 Bad Request:</strong></dt>
		<dd>The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters.</dd>

		<dt><strong>401 Unauthorized:</strong></dt>
		<dd>The request requires user authentication or the authentication failed.</dd>

		<dt><strong>404 Not Found:</strong></dt>
		<dd>The requested resource could not be found on the server.</dd>

		<dt><strong>500 Internal Server Error:</strong></dt>
		<dd>The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.</dd>
		  <dt><strong>300 Moved:</strong></dt>
        <dd>The requested resource has been moved to another location temporarily.</dd>

        <dt><strong>301 Permanently Moved:</strong></dt>
        <dd>The requested resource has been permanently moved to another location.</dd>

	</dl>

	<p>These status codes and responses help in understanding the outcome of an HTTP request and provide guidance on
		how to
		proceed.</p>
